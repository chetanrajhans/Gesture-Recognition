## General Information
Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions. You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:

Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds  
Stop: Pause the movie

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- After performing 10 experiments we have achieved training accuracy of 99% and validation accuracy of 90%
